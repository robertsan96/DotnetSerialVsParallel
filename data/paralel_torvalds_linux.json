These issues prevent the system\nfrom actually suspending, with errors like:\n\n  tpm tpm0: A TPM error (28) occurred continue selftest\n  ...\n  tpm tpm0: A TPM error (28) occurred attempting get random\n  ...\n  tpm tpm0: Error (28) sending savestate before suspend\n  tpm_tis 00:08: PM: __pnp_bus_suspend(): tpm_pm_suspend+0x0/0x80 returns 28\n  tpm_tis 00:08: PM: dpm_run_callback(): pnp_bus_suspend+0x0/0x10 returns 28\n  tpm_tis 00:08: PM: failed to suspend: error 28\n  PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected\n\nThis issue was partially fixed by 23393c646142 (\"char: tpm: Protect\ntpm_pm_suspend with locks\"), in a last minute 6.1 commit that Linus took\ndirectly because the TPM maintainers weren't available. However, it\nseems like this just addresses the most common cases of the bug, rather\nthan addressing it entirely. So there are more things to fix still,\napparently.\n\nIn lieu of actually fixing the underlying bug, just allow system suspend\nto continue, so that laptops still go to sleep fine. Later, this can be\nreverted when the real bug is fixed.\n\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/7cbe96cf-e0b5-ba63-d1b4-f63d2e826efa@suse.cz/\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 6.1+\nReported-by: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>\nSuggested-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>\nAcked-by: Luigi Semenzato <semenzato@chromium.org>\nCc: Peter Huewe <peterhuewe@gmx.de>\nCc: Jarkko Sakkinen <jarkko@kernel.org>\nCc: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>\nCc: Johannes Altmanninger <aclopte@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jason A.
