following:\n\n1. I renamed computeUseBlockLiveness to computeScalarUseBlockLiveness and\nchanged it to take a specific bit that it is testing for.\n\n2. I changed the logic that already existed in this code path that worked scalar\nby scalar to use scalar logic rather than call the broken multi-bit at a time\ncode path.\n\n3. We took advantage of resultingFoundLiveness now only returning the requested\nbits instead of all bits.
